# Member Content Archives

A module that adds the opportunity to assign any amount of content elements to a member categorized by archives and tags.

## Example usage
The motivation for this module has been the need for different member lists showing different amounts of content assigned
to members. By adding a category (tag) to a member content archive, you're able to tell your list module which archive(s) to
print out.

## InsertTags

- {{member_content_url::<member content archive id>}}
- {{member_content_url::<member id>::<tag id>}}
